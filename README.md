# jpeg_renaming
Routine to find all JPEG files in a folder and rename them based on the date in the metadata

This function will find all .jpg files in the same file path as the script and rename them
with the following serial convention: YYYY_MM_DD HH_MM_SS

This information is gathered from the JPEG metadata and requires a few packages
as listed in the import statements.
